	## This dataframe contains the error diagnosis of the analyzed articles that contained an error and has the following components: 
	## Source: Name of the file of which the statistic is extracted
	## 
	## Raw: Raw string of the statistical reference that is extracted
	## 
	## Computed: The recomputed p-value
	## 
	## OneTail: Logical. Is it likely that the reported p value resulted from a correction for one-sided testing?
	## 
	## CorrectRound: Logical. Is the reported p value correct when we take the possibility into account that the test statistic was rounded after calculating the corresponding p value? For instance, a reported t value of 2.35 could correspond to an actual value of 2.345 to 2.354 with a range of p values that can slightly deviate from the recomputed p value but still be correct.
	## RoundError: Logical. P value wrongly rounded upward or downward. E.g. rounding a p value of .049 to .04.
	## 
	## PSmallerThanZero: Logical. Reported p <.000.
	## 
	## SmallerInsteadEqual: Logical. Reported "<" when "=" would be correct. E.g. F(2,20)=2.33, p <.123, whereas the correct p value is equal to .123.
	## 
	## Bonferroni: Logical. Could the reported p value have resulted from a Bonferroni correction? Note: The corrected p values were calculated by multiplying the reported p values by the number of statistical results reported in one article. This is a rough estimation.
	## 
	## Unidentifiable: Logical. The error could not be classified on the basis of the extracted information.
	## 
	## CopyPaste: Logical. Does the exact string of the extracted raw results occur anywhere else in the article?
	## 
	## This dataframe contains an overview of the detected copy-paste errors in all the articles. Its components are the same as the ones in ErrorDiagnosis. Note that a copy-paste error could still be congruent in terms of test statistic and p value, so it is possible that these errors do not show up in ErrorDiagnosis. 
	## This dataframe provides a summary of all detected errors. It summarizes the number of detected errors in each of the aforementioned categories per article. The copy-paste errors are counted in a way that two identical strings of results are counted as one copy-paste error.
